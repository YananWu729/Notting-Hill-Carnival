![Project Preview](src/images/project-preview.png) 

**Level 3 Web Development Bootcamp Final Project**  
A responsive ticket booking system demonstrating core web development skills acquired during the course.

## 🚀 Project Overview
A functional ticket portal for London's Notting Hill Carnival, implementing:
- Real-time price calculations
- Interactive UI components
- Form validation
- DOM manipulation
- Responsive design principles

**Project Purpose**: Demonstrate competency in fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) while creating a practical, user-focused application.

## 🛠️ Featured Technical Skills
### Frontend Development
- **DOM Manipulation**: Live updates of pricing elements
- **Event Handling**: Input/change listeners for user interactions
